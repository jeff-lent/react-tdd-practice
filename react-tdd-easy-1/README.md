# React Component Practice

In this exercise, you will practice building a small todos list in the app component,
adding no extra components.

## Guidelines

- There must be 3 todos displayed on the page that were created from the state object
- All 3 todos must be wrapped in an unordered list
- Each todo must be a list item
- The todos property on the state object must be called `todos`
