# ReactJS Practice using TDD

## Overview
In this repo, each folder is its own problem. **YOU MUST RUN `npm install` OR `yarn` in each folder that you are doing or it won't work.** To run the tests, either run `yarn test` or `npm test`. You don't have to keep running those commands, though, because the testing flow built into `create-react-app` allows the test runner to just watch files as you change them, so no need to re-run `yarn test` or `npm test`.

## Getting Started
```
git clone https://github.com/johnazre/react-tdd-practice.git
cd whichever-folder-you-want
yarn OR npm install
atom . OR code .
yarn test OR npm test
```
